Research could span across Target Market, Market trend, Quality & customer feedback, Client behavior, Competitor Approach and never ending business needs. But most of these functions being conducted in-house gives the lop-sided view rather than a real holistic understanding.
This is the most common reason for new projects either failing or being delayed.
